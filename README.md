# Java Learning & Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on work while learning Java.
It focuses on building strong programming fundamentals through
problem solving, practice exercises, and structured topic-based study.

Rather than only following tutorials, this repository reflects
active learning through implementation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen Java fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Apply OOP concepts through code
- Improve coding structure and readability
- Build consistency through daily practice

---

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Methods and basic program structure
- Arrays and collections
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception handling
- Date & Time API
- Algorithm and logic problems

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
